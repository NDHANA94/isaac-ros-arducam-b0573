      # Durability: "volatile" or "transient_local"
      #   - volatile: Subscribers only receive messages published while they are active.
      #   - transient_local: Subscribers receive the last published message upon subscription, and then continue
      #       when to use volatile vs transient_local:
      #       - Use volatile for streaming data like camera images, where late-joining subscribers don't need the last frame.
      #       - Use transient_local for static or infrequently changing data like camera calibration, where late-joining subscribers should receive the last known calibration.
