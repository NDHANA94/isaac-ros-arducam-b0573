# Minimal GXF context graph for arducam_dual_camera.
# This graph is loaded by init_nitros_context() solely to satisfy the GXF
# runtime requirement for a valid application.  It contains no components;
# the scheduler warning ("No GXF scheduler specified") is expected and harmless.
# The actual purpose is to register nvidia::gxf::VideoBuffer (and related types)
# into the shared GXF context via the cuda + multimedia extensions loaded before
# this graph is applied.
